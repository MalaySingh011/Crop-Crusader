# Crop-Crusader
This repository is a comprehensive collection of the materials we utilized in our game submission for the FBLA State-level competitions. Within it, you will find a variety of assets including intricate artwork, thoughtfully crafted code, and other essential resources that contributed to our project. Our game is titled "Crop Crusader," and it immerses players in the life of a dedicated farmer who tirelessly battles to safeguard his land and maintain the delicate balance of nature.

In "Crop Crusader," players take on the role of the farmer, embarking on an epic journey to protect their farm from various challenges. Through strategic gameplay, players can combat the pervasive threat of world hunger, ultimately leading to a rewarding special ending where they are honored with the title of "Farmer." This title embodies their commitment to nurturing the Earth and its inhabitants.

Alternatively, players can confront the dangers posed by rampant industrialization. By defeating a series of cunning enemies unleashed by greedy entrepreneurs, they can uphold the integrity of the environment and secure the title of "Protector." This path emphasizes the importance of sustainable practices and the preservation of our planet.

However, should players falter in their efforts to achieve either of these noble goals, they will receive the designation of "Average Joe," a reminder of the challenges faced in their quest. Additionally, if their journey comes to a tragic end, they will be bestowed the somber title of "The Vanquished," serving as a testament to the trials encountered along the way.

Through this engaging narrative, "Crop Crusader" not only entertains but also encourages players to reflect on their role in fostering a sustainable future.
