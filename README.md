# Crop-Crusader
This repository contains the files we used in our game submission for the FBLA State-level competitions. It includes but is not limited to the artwork, the code, and the materials we used. Our submission is titled "Crop Crusader" because it follows the life of a farmer constantly fighting to protect his farm and preserve the Earth's balance and harmony. Through his actions, the player can save the world by eliminating the threat of world hunger. By doing so, they will unlock a special ending and gain the title of "Farmer". Furthermore, they can save the world from the threats of mass industrialization by defeating all of the enemies that are unleashed by avaricious entrepreneurs, unlocking the title of "Protector".
